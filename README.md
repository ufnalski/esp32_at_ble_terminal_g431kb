# ESP-AT BT/BLE connectivity for STM32 (STM32G431KB)
A similar story as for the [ESP-AT Wi-Fi connectivity](https://github.com/ufnalski/esp32_at_wifi_sntp_g431kb) but this time using BT/BLE.

> [!TIP]
> Use the blue button to configure the modem. Push the green button to connect to your phone. Use the yellow button to start receiving messages from the serial terminal installed on your phone.

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32G4xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.
